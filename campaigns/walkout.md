# Walkout

On Friday, April 15, 2022, primarily during the fourth period of the school day, members of the PVPHS ASB announced and distributed flyers advertising a planned student walkout.
The walkout is planned to occur on Monday, April 18, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. (PST).

It is believed that the planning of the student walkout was conducted by Activities Director Season Pollock, who is the PVPHS ASB director.
It is presumed that the creation and distribution of the flyers was also supervised by Ms. Pollock.

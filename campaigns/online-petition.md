## Change.org Petition

**REINSTATE OUR PRINCIPAL AND ATHLETICS DIRECTOR**

![Change.org Petition][3]

> The Palos Verdes Peninsula High School principal and athletics director have been placed on administrative leave.
> We believe that this has occurred unfairly and unnecessarily.

> There has been no communication to the staff and students of Peninsula High School from the school board or the district on the actions that have taken place.
> Furthermore, our principal and athletics director were removed for no reason. A walk-on coach at Pen is being investigated and worked with, and their actions have nothing to do with Dr. Kuykendall and Mr. Van Enk.
> Our principal and athletics director are completely separate from the situation.

> We, as students, have always been taught to stick up for what’s right, and to fight for those who care about us.
> If you don’t know Dr. Kuykendall and Mr. Van Enk, they care about this school and us, and work hard everyday to make it the loving environment that is Peninsula.
> We feel very strongly that when someone from our family is treated unfairly, we will do everything in our power to show them our support.

> We do not tolerate abuse of power.
> We do not tolerate injustice.
> We do not tolerate the forceful removal of our faculty.

> WE WANT DR. KUYKENDALL AND MR. VAN ENK RETURNED TO CAMPUS IMMEDIATELY.

On Friday, April 1, 2022, PVPHS Principal Dr. Brent Kuykendall and PVPHS Athletic Director Glenn Van Enk were forced to take administrative leave, presumably by the PVPUSD Board of Educators.
An explanation for the move was disclosed to neither the school faculty nor the student body.
It is likely that the school administration is aware of the reasons for such a move, but this has not been confirmed.

During the day, the PVPHS ASB visited various classrooms (primarily during the fourth period) to discuss the aforementioned issue.
The ASB-affiliated students distributed flyers informing the general student body of a planned student walk-out, scheduled for 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m. (PST) on Monday, April 18, 2022.

The content of the repository attempts to provide the PVPHS community (including but not limited to the students, parents of the students, and teachers) of plausible causes of the forced administrative leaved.
The repository also discusses the potential implications of the planned student walk-out.
